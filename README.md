# Tacos

Welcome to my taco truck! 
Here you can place an order for a new taco, with your choice of meat, what type of shell, and if you'd like it vegetarian or not (we have tofu substitutions for every meat imaginable, so don't be afraid to ask for whatever).
After your order is placed, your taco will appear under the list of fufilled orders to be picked up by you, where it will then move to your side of the screen for you to consume.
To use this application you will need:
1. Express
2. Mysql
3. Express-handlebars
